# WishList API: Public Sample

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create a Quick Live Server

[https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wishlist-public-api](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wishlist-public-api)

Click on the "Remix to Edit" button in the top-right corner.

### 2. Test the Live Server

In your Glitch project, click on the "Share" button, which you can find under the project name in the top-left corner.

```bash

```

Open your terminal application (or any other application that you can use to make HTTP Requests, such as Postman).

Test if the server is working by making the following request to get all the wishlist items:

```bash
curl https://<random-long-string>.glitch.me/api/wishlist/items
```

You should the following response from the server (the `id`'s will vary):

```json
